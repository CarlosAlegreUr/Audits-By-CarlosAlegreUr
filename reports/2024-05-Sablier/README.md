According to the developers:

---

_`Sablier is a permissionless token distribution protocol for ERC-20 assets. It can be used for vesting, payroll, airdrops, and more. The sender of a payment stream first deposits a specific amount of ERC-20 tokens in a contract. Then, the contract progressively allocates the funds to the recipient, who can access them as they become available over time. The payment rate is influenced by various factors such as the start time, the end time, the total amount of tokens deposited and the type of stream.`_
