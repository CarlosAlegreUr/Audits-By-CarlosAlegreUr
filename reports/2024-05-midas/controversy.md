The reason of invalidation of these 2 issues in this very centralized protocol was: `handleded-off-chain`.

- Issue1 -> [here](./Medium/Medium2-DecimalsBreakMinDepositCheck.md)
- Issue2 -> [here](./Medium/Medium1-ChainlinkChecksAreIncorrect.md)

I think this an unacceptable excuse. They should have been valid, simply because, if you are monitoring all that off-chain why do you even need those checks on the smart contracts in the first place? You don't, it's useless flawed code.
