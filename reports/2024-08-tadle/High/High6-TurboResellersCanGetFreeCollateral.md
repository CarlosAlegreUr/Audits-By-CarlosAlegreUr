## Summary üìå

Re-sellers in turbo mode can use their offer structs to settle tokens and retrieve collateral they never deposited.

---

## Vulnerability Details üîç && Impact üìà

In a turbo chain of sellings, only first seller deposits collateral, next dont.

During this events, `Offer` structs are created for re-sellers. Problem is these offer structs can be used in `settleAskMaker()` during settlement. If the re-sellers also owns tokens, they can use their own tokens to withdraw collateral from the system they never deposited in the first place.

If the collateral that can be drainned is worth more than the tokens they got they will do it. Even if it was unprofitable this is still really bad as they are getting free collateral therefore undercollateralizing the system which, when all is settled will result in someone not being able to retrieve his full collateral amount.

## Recommendations üéØ

Do not allow `Offers` that come from a turbo maker to be settled as they do not relate to any collateral being deposited. For that you can just check the `maker` member of an `Offer` struct.
