# High Risk Issue: `Size` üïµÔ∏è

# **Users can pay less fees for the same amount of cash, protocol losses expected income**

---

### **Explanation && Impact** üìåüìà

On the ***PoC-1*** below you will see that for the same tenor and same APR:

|               | `OPTION 1` | `OPTION 2` |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| cash borrowed | 99_500000  | 100_000000 |
| Swap Fees     | 0_500000   | 0_500000   |

- _OPTION 1_: Bob puts a borrow offer, then Alice uses `buyCreditMarket` action
- _OPTION 2_: Alice puts lending offer, then Bob uses `sellCreditMarket` action

The problem arises from `sellCreditMarket` where the fees are calculated on the `cashAmountOut`, which is expected to have deducted from it the fees. `cashAmountOut` is actually the result of applying the fees to some amount **X**. Yet it is treated as if it were the amount **X** inside the function `getCreditAmountIn()`. And `X > cashAmountOut`, thus the proportional fees calculated on top of **X** will be bigger than the ones calcualted on `cashAmountOut`. So, as `cashAmountOut` is used in `getCreditAmountIn()`, that is why you are charging less fees for bigger amounts of cash.

In _OPTION-2_, you are calculating [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/AccountingLibrary.sol#L249) the fees on an amount which has already fees deducted from it, thus calculating them in a smaller amount that the actual amount they should be calculated from. Which is X => `X = cashAmountOut / (1-swapFee)`.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note** üìò You can deduce `X = cashAmountOut / (1-swapFee)` from `X - swapFee*X = cashAmountOut`. This equation is basically answering the question, if `cashAmountOut` came from something **X** being deducted swapFee, what was that something **X**?

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note** üìò We know that in `sellCreditMarket`, `cashAmountOut` is meant to have fees deducted as this amount is directly transfered to the borrower at the end of the function. [See here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/src/libraries/actions/SellCreditMarket.sol#L201). And the borrower pays `swapFee` due to the _cash-for-credit_ operation he is executing thus the amount he ends up receiving should be an amount with already deducted `swapFee` from.

The impact of this issue is pretty bad for the protocol as it receives less fees than the expected ones. Users can get more credit for the same amount of fees payed. This is a loss for the protocol as they are receiving less fees than they should.

Same happens when exiting loans via `sellCreditMarket` (***PoC-2***) when there is a partial exit. The lender of the position being exited can choose how much `swapFees` to be charged:

|               | `OPTION 1` | `OPTION 2` |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| credit exited | 50_000000  | 50_000000  |
| Total Fees    | 5_681819   | 5_655683   |

When partially exiting the impact is also less fees charged and those fees not-charged are extra earnings for the user who makes a _credit-for-cash_ operation (in ***PoC-2*** that user is Candy, at _OPTION-2_). This is a loss for the protocol and a user receiving more money that she should.

### **Proof Of Concept (PoC)** üë®‚Äçüíªüíª

Paste the tests below it in some test file `(./test/local/actions/*.t.sol)` on the system, import foundry _console.log_ in that file: `import "forge-std/console.sol";`. And run:

```bash
# For the first PoC
forge test --match-test "test_feecheckReservedCash" -vv
```

Before running the second PoC with:

```bash
forge test --match-test "test_feecheckExitW" -vv
```

You must paste this function inside `BaseTest.sol` contract, [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/test/BaseTest.sol#L185):

### **Recommended Actions** üõ†Ô∏è

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note** üöß After applying these reocomendations the PoCs provided work as expected, yet 7 test from the original `forge test` will fail. This is not due to the recommendation being wrong or the issue not true, it is due to the very same tests being wrong. The way is wrong is that their `asserts` check in the users' balances agains an increase/decrease of an amount calculated using a homemade calculated `swapFee`. Which is calculated from the same amount they use as input, and the core issue is that the very same amount you use as input is expected to already have fees deducted from it, not to calculate fees from it and then deduct them. See for example [this assertion](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/test/local/actions/SellCreditMarket.t.sol#L404), which uses to `50e6`, the same amount passed as `params.amount` a few lines above [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/main/test/local/actions/SellCreditMarket.t.sol#L400C57-L400C60). But this 50 indicates the exact amount of cash that Bob (in this test) wishes to receive, which is the amount Bob has to receive after all fees have been deducted. The other 6 tests that fail actually fail for the same reasons and I've listed them at the end of the issue report.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note** üöß Even though I checked that all tests revert for this right reason, I recommend the dev team to double-check that this way of fixing the issue makes sense. 


At `getCreditAmountIn()` you should calculate the `swapFees` on the amount that did not have fees deducted from it yet. Thus you should calculate the fees on some `X = cashAmountOut / (1-swapFeePercent)`. Something like `fees = Math.mulDivUp(X, swapFeePercent, PERCENT);`.

And, in the part of the function that deals with fragmentation, fragmentation fee should also be taken into acount when figuring out the **X**.

I've deduced the fixes from the code docs and logic (using the notation they use in their docs, [see here](https://docs.size.credit/technical-docs/contracts/3.3-market-orders#id-3.3.1-sell-credit-market-order-borrowing-market-order)):

Here is the code I used to fix the issue:

```diff
    function getCreditAmountIn(
        State storage state,
        uint256 cashAmountOut,
        uint256 maxCashAmountOut,
        uint256 maxCredit,
        uint256 ratePerTenor,
        uint256 tenor
    ) internal view returns (uint256 creditAmountIn, uint256 fees) {
        uint256 swapFeePercent = getSwapFeePercent(state, tenor);

        uint256 maxCashAmountOutFragmentation = 0;

        if (maxCashAmountOut >= state.feeConfig.fragmentationFee) {
            maxCashAmountOutFragmentation = maxCashAmountOut - state.feeConfig.fragmentationFee;
        }

        // slither-disable-next-line incorrect-equality
        if (cashAmountOut == maxCashAmountOut) {
            // no credit fractionalization

+           // V before fees = maxCredit / (1+ratePerTenor)
+           uint256 discountedCashValue = Math.mulDivUp(maxCredit, PERCENT, PERCENT + ratePerTenor);

            creditAmountIn = maxCredit;
-           fees = Math.mulDivUp(cashAmountOut, swapFeePercent, PERCENT); // ORIGINAL
+           fees = Math.mulDivUp(discountedCashValue, swapFeePercent, PERCENT);
        } else if (cashAmountOut < maxCashAmountOutFragmentation) {
            // credit fractionalization

+           // Notice here we must take into account the frag fee, but creditAmountIn is already correctly calculated with it
            creditAmountIn = Math.mulDivUp(
                cashAmountOut + state.feeConfig.fragmentationFee, PERCENT + ratePerTenor, PERCENT - swapFeePercent
            );

+           uint256 discountedCashValue = Math.mulDivUp(creditAmountIn, PERCENT, PERCENT + ratePerTenor);
+           uint256 correctSwapFee = Math.mulDivUp(discountedCashValue, swapFeePercent, PERCENT);
-           fees = Math.mulDivUp(cashAmountOut, swapFeePercent, PERCENT) + state.feeConfig.fragmentationFee; // ORIGINAL
+            fees = correctSwapFee + state.feeConfig.fragmentationFee;
        } else {
            // for maxCashAmountOutFragmentation < amountOut < maxCashAmountOut we are in an inconsistent situation
            //   where charging the swap fee would require to sell a credit that exceeds the max possible credit

            revert Errors.NOT_ENOUGH_CASH(maxCashAmountOutFragmentation, cashAmountOut);
        }
    }
```

All 7 test that will revert but it's okay:

- testFuzz_SellCreditMarket_sellCreditMarket_exactAmountOut_properties
- testFuzz_SellCreditMarket_sellCreditMarket_used_to_borrow
- test_SellCreditMarket_sellCreditMarket_used_to_borrow
- test_Multicall_multicall_bypasses_cap_if_it_is_to_reduce_debt
