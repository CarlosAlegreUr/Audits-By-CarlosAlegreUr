## Vulnerability Details

Tokens like USDC have blacklists to comply with law enforcement. If a criminal commits a crime and sends the USDC to **SablierFlow** it will make the **SablierFlow** contract be blacklisted, freezing everyone's USDC flows on the system including honest users.

## Impact

A blacklist scenario by only 1 criminal can punish the entire users of Sablier Flow freezing forever all USDC (or any token with a blacklist) deposited in Flows.

Note that not even the `SablierFlowBase::recover()` would work as it transfers the [surplus](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-10-sablier/blob/main/src/abstracts/SablierFlowBase.sol#L231). So if the criminal sends the USDC in the shape of a stream via `create()` then the surplus generated by the criminal sent funds will be 0.

## Recommendations

Make, at least the funds being flowed, be held by separate contracts and not just one. This way if any criminal ends up sending crime money to **SableirFlow** system, leaving the eventual receiver blacklisted, then only the funds in that other contract will be frozen and not the entire system.

To cheapen gas costs you can deploy a logic contract and the other funds holders just be proxies that _delegatecall_ the logic.

Example:

_Currently_ -> All funds held by **SablierFlow** contract.

_Fix_ -> Keeps the logic but associate each `streamId` to a contract that holds the `balance` of that stream and which has the transfer logic. In this case, the criminal funds will land there and just that address will be blacklisted.
