According to the developers:

---

_`The contracts implement a voting-escrow incentivization model for Canto RWA (Real World Assets) similar to veCRV with its liquidity gauge. Users can lock up CANTO (for five years) in the VotingEscrow contract to get veCANTO. They can then vote within GaugeController for different lending markets that are white-listed by governance. Users that provide liquidity within these lending markets can claim CANTO (that is provided by CANTO governance) from LendingLedger according to their share.`_
