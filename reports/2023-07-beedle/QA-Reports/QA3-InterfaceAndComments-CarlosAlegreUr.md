## Summary 📌

I'm suggesting some refactoring and additional comments to enhance code readability and comprehension.

## Vulnerability Details 🔍

### **Refactor: Interface Creation** 🛠️:

Create `ILender.sol`. Have `Lender.sol` inherit from it. This encapsulates events and provides clarity about the functions in the `Lender.sol` contract and their purposes.

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;
// Some imports...

interface ILender {
    // The events...
    event Borrowed();
    event Repaid();
    // Functions with their documentation, preferably using NatSpec
}
```

### Comments' Improvements 🖊️

- **Beedle.sol** : This contract lacks comments. Please provide context and documentation.
- **Fees.sol** : Include a summary comment at the beginning detailing the contract's purpose and functions.

- **Existing Comments Enhancement Proposal**:
  For instance, in `setPool()`, include:

  ```
  @notice Ensure the lender approves the required token transfers before invoking.
  ```

  This last proposal should be added in any function that involves token `transferFrom`. Those functions are:

  - `addToPool`
  - `borrow()`
  - `repay()`
  - `refinance()`

It is recommended that **these comment suggestions are applied to the rest of the codebase and in future modifications to it**.

## Impact 📈

These modifications are predicted to reduce the time future developers spend understanding the code components, resulting in a faster development environment.

## Tools Used 🛠️

- Manual audit.

## Recommendations 🎯

Spending time properly commenting the code when a project is complex is essential. It saves lots of time for developers trying to understand and work or improve the codebase.

> 🚧 **Note** ⚠️: I've previously sent a report suggesting deeper structural changes to `Lender.sol`. However, if implementing those changes proves too time-consuming or complex for the dev team, this current suggestion offers a less intensive alternative that still enhances code quality.
