## **Summary 📌**

This finding relates to front-running opportunities in **`Lender.sol`** and the associated increasing costs within this system.

## **Vulnerability Details 🔍**

### **Front-running Concerns** 🚫

In the absence of protective mechanisms, **transactions that spot lucrative opportunities** may be outpaced by others willing to pay higher gas prices, resulting in the original transaction's failure.

Such situations could arise in the `borrow()` function where two **competing borrowers** might **inflate their gas prices** to secure the same pool.

This elevates the gas costs associated with system usage.

The same problem arises during `buyLoan()` with multiple parties driving up gas prices for the same loan auction.

Similarly, in the `giveLoan()` function, multiple parties might compete to assign their loan to another lender's pool.

## **Impact 📈**

Front-running can substantially **increase users' transaction costs**, especially in competitive contracts with numerous users.

The issue might not directly risk funds in the traditional sense of theft or loss, but it poses a significant indirect risk. Users could be consistently outbid, leading to financial loss due to **wasted transactions**. As mentioned, in competitive environments, this could lead to substantial costs.

Consequently, consistent transaction failures or high fees could **damage the system's reputation**, causing users to rethink using the service.

## **Tools Used 🛠️**

- Manual audit.

## **Recommendations 🎯**

Despite the complexity they can add to the system, I recommend using:

**Commitment-reveal schemes** 💡

The added complexity is worth it when considering the potential discontent from clients and the **competitive edge** that a similar protocol could gain if they adopted such measures.

> 📘 **Notice** ℹ️: Commitment-reveal schemes can also solve some block validators' abuse the `Lender.sol` contract has due to the use of block.timestamp. I've submitted the details in another finding.

> 🚧 **Note** ⚠️: Commitment-reveal schemes are not straightforward. After their implementation, a subsequent audit is essential.

<details> <summary> Implementation Steps for a Commitment-Reveal Scheme 🗺️ </summary>

### **Implementation Steps for a Commitment-Reveal Scheme**:

1. 📜 **Commit Phase**:

   - Users send a hashed combination of their choice (function selector to call and the desired value of the inputs, for example) and a secret value (like a nonce or a random number) to the contract.
   - This hashed value represents their "commitment" and is stored without revealing the actual choice.

2. 🕵️ **Reveal Phase**:

   - After all commitments are received, users are required to send their original choice and secret value during the reveal phase.
   - The contract then verifies the commitment by hashing the revealed data and comparing it with the stored hash.

3. 🎬 **Action Phase**:

   - Once all relevant reveals are completed and verified, the desired function (like `borrow()`, `buyLoan()`, or `giveLoan()`) is executed based on the revealed choices.

4. 🛡️ **Guard Measures**:

   - To prevent participants from not revealing after committing, consider implementing penalties or incentives.
   - Use time-bound mechanisms to transition between commit, reveal, and action phases.

5. ✅ **Integrity Checks**:
   - Ensure that the contract logic accounts for cases where users send incorrect reveal data or fail to reveal within the allocated time.
