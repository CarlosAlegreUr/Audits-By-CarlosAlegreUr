2 issues were invalidated due to "out-of-scope".

**B** inherits **A**, **B** is the list of in-scope contracts **A** is not.

Fixing the issues require modifying **A**, and even **A** is clearly part of the byte-code of **B**, as it was not in the "in-scope" section, has been deemed invalid.

Totally disagree on this approach to validity.
