#### Invalidated 🟤

> ⚠️ I did not check in depth all invalidation reasons. I considered my time to be more valuable if spent on other things like in real life DevCon 2024. Still, as talked with my teamate, the judging of this contest felt a bit rushed, messed and shallow, so I'm afraid some of these invalidations might be actually valid. ⚠️
