# Project ℹ️

This project is made by the **`Cyfrin`** team. Its audit was part of an audit competition at CodeHawks.

According to the developers:

```
This project is meant to be a stablecoin where users can deposit WETH and WBTC in exchange for a token that will be pegged to the USD. The system is meant to be such that someone could fork this codebase, swap out WETH & WBTC for any basket of assets they like, and the code would work the same.
```
